They can contain anything you like.\r\n\r\n### The Workspace\r\n\r\nWorkspace contains and handles sets of panels.\r\n\r\n### The Workspace Manager\r\n\r\nWorkspace Manager contains multiple workspaces.\r\n\r\nWith these three building blocks you can build one dashboard to rule them all.\r\n\r\n## Example Setup\r\n\r\n    var WorkspaceManager = genera.WorkspaceManager,\r\n        Workspace = genera.Workspace,\r\n        Panel = genera.Panel;\r\n\r\n    var manager = new WorkspaceManager({\r\n      container: $('#container')\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var workspace = new Workspace({\r\n      name: 'Home'\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    manager.addWorkspace(workspace);\r\n    manager.goToWorkspace(workspace);\r\n\r\n    workspace.addPanel(new Panel({}));\r\n\r\n## Extending Panels\r\n\r\nPanels are only a skeleton to contain what you define. Here's an example.\r\n\r\n    var Panel = genera.Panel;\r\n\r\n    function ExtendedPanel(opts) {\r\n      if (opts) {\r\n        Panel.call(this, opts);\r\n        this.container.append('<h3>' + opts.title + '</h3>');\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    genera.Base.inherit(ExtendedPanel, Panel);\r\n\r\n    workspace.addPanel(new ExtendedPanel({ title: 'New Panel' });\r\n\r\nYou can define handlers for several events on a Panel:\r\n\r\n* `onAttach`: when a Panel is attached to a Workspace\r\n* `onRemove`: when a Panel is removed from a Workspace\r\n* `onEnter`: when the parent Workspace enters into view\r\n* `onLeave`: when the parent Workspace leaves view\r\n* `onClone`: when the Panel is cloned\r\n* `onDragStart`: when a Panel has begun a drag action\r\n* `onDrag`: when a Panel is dragged\r\n* `onDragEnd`: when a Panel has stopped a drag action\r\n\r\nThere are also some other methods you'll want to override:\r\n\r\n* `toJSON`: Return the serialized version of your Panel to be saved into store\r\n\r\n## Example Dashboard\r\n\r\nSee index.html for an example dashboard setup utilizing all building blocks of Genera."}
